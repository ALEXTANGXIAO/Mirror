Depending on the severity of the exploit, we offer a $50 - $500 bug bounty.

**Specifically we are looking for:**
* Ways to crash a Mirror server.
* Ways to exploit a Mirror server.
* Ways to leave a Mirror server in undefined state.

We are **not** looking for DOS/DDOS attacks, as those are expected to be handled by the hosting infrastructure.
